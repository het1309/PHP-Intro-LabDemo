        -> "PHP Intelephense" by Ben Mewburn Provides intelligent code completion, linting, and other advanced language features for PHP.

    b) Quick Start Procedure (Important for Intelephense):
        1. After installing the "PHP Intelephense" extension, you must disable VS Code's built-in PHP Language Features to avoid conflicts.

        3. In the Extensions search bar, type @builtin PHP.    
        4. Locate "PHP Language Features" and click the Disable button next to it.
        5. Crucially, leave "PHP Language Basics" enabled, as this provides essential syntax highlighting.

    -> Open VS Code Settings (File > Preferences > Settings or Ctrl+,). And then, 
        Search for "files.associations".
        Click "Edit in settings.json" if prompted, or directly add/modify the JSON object.

        "files.associations": {
        "*.module": "php",
        "*.inc": "php", // Example for .inc files
        }
